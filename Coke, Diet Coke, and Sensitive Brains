Plain Language Summary: Coke, Diet Coke, and Sensitive Brains
What We're Saying (and Not Saying)
The claim:
For most people, Coke and Diet Coke are just sweet drinks. But for a small group with extra-sensitive nervous systems, these drinks may act like mild stimulant drugs—not strong, but real enough to change mood, sleep, and create hard-to-break habits.
What we're NOT saying:

This does not claim that Coca-Cola is breaking the law
This does not claim that standard formulations are unsafe for the general population
This is not arguing everyone should stop drinking soda

What we ARE saying:
For a subset of highly susceptible individuals, Coke/Diet Coke may function as mild, legal micro-stimulants. Given their unique coca-derived flavoring, trace alkaloids should be treated as the leading mechanistic suspect to test first—not because they're proven guilty, but because they should be rigorously tested and either cleared or confirmed, rather than being assumed irrelevant by default.

The Core Problem: When "Just a Soda" Isn't Just a Soda
Most people can drink Coke or Diet Coke without thinking twice. It's a treat, a habit, a brand they grew up with. For them, it's background noise in the nervous system.
But there is another group—often misdiagnosed, dismissed, or confused by their own reactions—for whom Coke and Diet Coke do not behave like neutral beverages. A small glass can be followed by a surge of anxiety the next day. A single bottle can flip sleep from "fine" to "wired until 3 a.m." They can drink coffee, other sodas, or energy drinks without the same crash, yet Coke or Diet Coke keep showing up as a reliable trigger.
At the same time, these same people often find they:

Crave Coke/Diet Coke specifically
Struggle to stop despite repeated attempts, and
Use it—consciously or not—as a way to control their state: to focus, to calm, to push through fatigue, or to feel "normal"

The culture calls this "just soda." The marketing calls it "a feeling." But for a subset of susceptible nervous systems, what's happening looks closer to a mild, legal micro-stimulant relationship than a simple beverage choice.

Who This Affects: Susceptible Nervous Systems
"Susceptible individuals" = people whose nervous systems respond more strongly and more persistently to psychoactive inputs than average.
This often includes people with:

Chronic anxiety or hyperarousal
ADHD or trauma histories
Heightened sensitivity to medications or recreational drugs
A pattern of experiencing outsized effects from relatively small doses

These are the people who feel:

Half a tablet when others need two
One espresso like a triple shot
A tiny dose change in psychiatric meds that barely moves the lab values

For them, "trace," "sub-clinical," and "negligible" don't always behave the way pharmacology textbooks say they should.
You might be in this group if you've ever described yourself as having an "insane affinity to trace amounts"—where tiny exposures that would be irrelevant to most people reliably change how you feel.

Why Some Brains Are "Too Sensitive" to Ignore
Even among people with similar diagnoses (anxiety, ADHD, trauma), not all brains respond to psychoactive inputs in the same way. Some can drink multiple coffees or colas with little subjective change. Others experience outsized effects from what appear to be modest or even trivial doses.
There are several layers to this variability:
Genetics: How Fast You Clear Drugs
Some people carry gene variants (in liver enzymes like CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) that alter how quickly they metabolize caffeine, psychiatric medications, or other compounds.

"Slow metabolizers" can experience higher and longer-lasting exposure from the same dose
A standard amount of caffeine can feel like a double dose if their clearance is delayed

Genetics: How Fast You Break Down Brain Chemicals
Genes like COMT and MAO help break down dopamine, noradrenaline, and related neurotransmitters. Variants that reduce their activity can lead to:

Higher synaptic levels of dopamine/noradrenaline
Exaggerated responses to anything that nudges these systems

In practical terms:

A small stimulant hit feels bigger
"Trace" stimulation may be enough to change state
The nervous system may learn to rely on these micro-pushes to feel "normal"

This matches the lived description many susceptible people give: tiny exposures that would be irrelevant to most people reliably change how they feel.
Sensitization: Your Brain Gets MORE Sensitive Over Time
This is critical: Sensitization is the process by which repeated exposure to a drug or stimulus makes the system respond more strongly over time, even to smaller doses.
What animal studies show:

Doses that are "sub-threshold" (too small to cause reward or obvious behavioral change in naïve animals) can start to produce reward-seeking behavior after the system has been sensitized
Prior exposure in adolescence can make adult animals more reactive to later low doses, with changes in brain signaling
Stress and trauma models increase sensitivity to low-dose stimulants, amplifying responses that were previously negligible

We do not yet have equivalent ultra-low-dose data in sensitized humans, especially not at the level of everyday products like cola. But the animal work clearly shows one thing:
Thresholds are not fixed.
Once a brain has been sensitized, the dose at which "nothing happens" in a naïve system may very much be "something" in a high-gain one.
For susceptible individuals drinking 1–2 L/day of Coke or Diet Coke, with ADHD, trauma or prior stimulant exposure in the background, it is therefore entirely plausible that what looks like a "harmless beverage dose" to the average person is functioning as a meaningful state-control input for them.

The Voltmeter on the Wrong Setting
This is where the "voltmeter on the wrong setting" analogy becomes important.
Most of our toxicology, pharmacology, and safety assumptions are calibrated on average, naïve systems—people without major sensitization, without extreme genetic quirks, and without nervous systems reshaped by chronic stress or trauma. In that population, you set the meter to the "10-amp" range:

You only see large, obvious effects at moderate to high doses, and
Anything below that is recorded as "nothing happens"

But susceptible individuals are not running that hardware. They are sensitized, genetically unusual, or trauma-primed nervous systems operating more like high-gain amplifiers. For them, the same input can land very differently:

A dose that is sub-threshold and invisible on the "10-amp" setting may be clearly detectable—physiologically and subjectively—if you switch the meter down to the milliamp range

When we say "trace," "sub-clinical," or "negligible" based on data from average subjects and coarse tools, we are not actually proving there is no effect in susceptible brains; we are only proving that:

We have not looked at the right sensitivity, in the right population, with the right questions.

This is the crux of the methodological critique:
Regulatory voltmeters are pointed at the wrong nervous systems.

The Nicotine-in-the-Water Analogy: How Trace Can Still Matter
A useful way to visualize this:

Take someone with a strong nicotine dependence
Put a tiny amount of nicotine—well below usual "active dose" thresholds—into a glass of water

For a non-smoker, that's functionally nothing.
For a heavily dependent smoker who is in withdrawal, that same trace amount may shift craving, mood, or body sensation in ways they can detect.
From the outside, the dose looks "too small to matter."
From inside a sensitized, receptor-hungry system, it absolutely matters.
This is the analogy for trace coca-derived alkaloids in Coke/Diet Coke for a sensitized subset:

To the average brain: noise
To a dopamine-starved, ADHD, anxious, or trauma-primed system that has been pairing this drink with state improvement for years:

One more micro-signal in the direction of "this fixes me"
One more drop in the glass that the voltmeter can't see but the nervous system can



The key point:

"Trace" does not mean "zero effect" in a brain that is primed to hear whispers.


Why Coke Might Hit Different: Beyond "Just Caffeine and Sugar"
There are many reasons Coke/Diet Coke might feel different from other caffeinated drinks:

Caffeine dose and timing
Sugar vs artificial sweetener dynamics
Carbonation and gastric absorption
Brand conditioning and ritual

All of these matter. But the critical observation is:

When you hold most of those constant across other drinks, many susceptible people still report that Coke/Diet Coke "hit different"—physiologically and psychologically.

What Competing Explanations Could Account For
Several non-cola-specific mechanisms could plausibly account for much of the effect in susceptible individuals:

Caffeine genetics (slow vs fast metabolizers)
Sugar vs artificial sweeteners and their metabolic and reward effects
Carbonation and how it affects absorption in the stomach
Conditioning, ritual, and brand association over years

All of these likely contribute. However, they are not unique to Coke/Diet Coke: many coffees, colas, and energy drinks share similar caffeine loads, sweetener profiles, and carbonation yet do not reliably produce the same pattern of:

Coke-specific craving
Next-day anxiety
"This drink hits different" reports

...in susceptible people.
That asymmetry is why this paper treats coca-derived flavour components as the leading mechanistic candidate to test first: they are the one major ingredient that is both biologically interesting and unique to the products that generate this clinical pattern.
The Working Model for Susceptible Brains
Baseline: A nervous system with:

ADHD, anxiety, trauma, or stress history
Possible genetic variants affecting drug clearance and dopamine breakdown
Prior stimulant exposures and sensitization

Input: A beverage that combines:

Caffeine (stimulant)
Sugar or artificial sweeteners (metabolic and reward signaling)
Carbonation (modulates absorption)
Coca-derived flavour components from decocainized extracts, potentially including trace non-cocaine alkaloids and other bioactives

Result in susceptible brains:

Small but reliable changes in dopamine/noradrenaline tone
Repeated pairing of "I drink this" with "I can finally focus / feel normal / calm my chaos"
Gradual consolidation into a micro-stimulant dependency loop

The claim is NOT:

"Coke has enough cocaine to be a secret illegal stimulant"

The claim IS:

For a small but important subset of nervous systems, Coke/Diet Coke behave as if they were micro-stimulants. Given the unique coca-derived flavour source, trace alkaloids should be treated as the leading mechanistic candidate to test first, until exonerated by data.


What Existing Data Tells Us About Low Doses and Sensitization
Existing animal and human data, while not designed for cola-level exposures, already show the basic shape of the problem:
A) EVIDENCE-BACKED:
Repeated low doses can flip a system into hypersensitivity

In rats, even sub-threshold cocaine doses (too small to cause reward or obvious behavioral change in naïve animals) can trigger conditioned place preference—a reward-seeking behavior—after sensitization

Early exposure increases later sensitivity

Adolescent cocaine exposure makes adult animals more sensitive to later low doses, activating more neurons and inducing "feel off" stress-like changes

Sensitization shifts dopamine signaling thresholds

Chronic cocaine can dampen baseline dopamine during intoxication but make the system more reactive to low doses over time
In both humans and animals, repeated use increases sensitivity to toxic effects (anxiety, paranoia) at lower doses than were initially required

Hypersensitive models show dramatic changes after repetition

Mouse models with sensory hypersensitivity may show low initial sensitivity to cocaine but massive increases after repeated exposure

Binding studies are calibrated for big doses, not traces

Dopamine transporter occupancy studies typically examine milligram-scale doses
Yet sensitization studies show that sub-threshold doses can elicit movement or reward after priming
We have essentially no nano/microgram-level data in sensitized humans

B) WHAT THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS:
Taken together, these findings suggest:

Sensitization enhances sub-threshold activity in dopamine pathways
Low doses can calm or normalize in some contexts and trigger anxiety in others, depending on prior history and state
Stress and trauma increase sensitization to low-dose stimulants

In other words:

In wired, sensitized, or susceptible systems, the "wrong setting on the voltmeter" really does hide real signals. The absence of evidence at coarse resolution and in average populations is not evidence of absence for people whose nervous systems are running in milliamp mode.


What It Looks Like in Real Life: Clinical Patterns
Clinically and anecdotally, a recognizable pattern keeps appearing around Coke and Diet Coke in susceptible individuals. These are not people who "just like soda." They often report that:

They can drink other sodas, coffee, or energy drinks without the same psychological fallout
Yet Coke or Diet Coke consistently hit different—in how they feel, how they crave, and how hard it is to stop

Common Features:
Next-day anxiety or mood shifts

Correlate specifically with Coke/Diet Coke, not with other caffeine or sugar sources
People describe going from a relatively calm day (anxiety 2–3/10) to a sudden spike (8–10/10) the following day after what they considered "a small amount" of Coke
Usually without realizing the connection for years

Heavy, entrenched use patterns

Drinking Coke or Diet Coke as the primary daily fluid (multiple cans or bottles per day)
Barely touching water or other beverages
Often maintained for years

Difficulty quitting that feels disproportionate to "just a drink"

Repeated failed attempts to cut down
Strong pushback when abstinence is suggested
A noticeable emotional reaction to the idea of stopping
Even in people who freely admit it may be bad for their health or anxiety

Use as a performance or state-control tool

To focus, to push through fatigue, to stabilize mood before tasks
In athletic contexts where other equally caffeinated options are available but not perceived as equivalent

History of stimulant or cocaine use (in some cases)

Coke or Diet Coke becoming the "acceptable," legal, socially invisible substitute once illegal drugs are stopped
The relationship to the drink looks more like dependence than preference

Changes in subjective taste or body sensation

Suddenly finding Diet Coke "disgustingly sweet"
Feeling tingling in the lips when chugging Coke
Describing it as "too intense"
Yet continued consumption despite this aversion—more consistent with a dependency loop than simple enjoyment

The "Study Fuel" Pattern
Some susceptible individuals also describe Coke or Diet Coke as their "study fuel" long before they ever touch formal ADHD medication. They report that these drinks help them lock in and focus in a way coffee never did—cramming months of material into a single night and actually retaining it.
In retrospect, this pattern looks less like coincidence and more like a genuine micro-stimulant effect in ADHD brains, where the specific combination of caffeine, sugar or sweetener, and possibly trace coca-derived alkaloids nudges dopamine and noradrenaline just enough to temporarily normalize focus.
The Psychiatrist's Half-Joke
This lines up with a widely shared, half-joking clinical observation:

Many psychiatrists say they can "spot undiagnosed ADHD by how many Diet Cokes or chocolate stashes a patient has."

Behind the joke is a consistent picture—under-treated or unrecognized ADHD patients, often women, self-medicating with Diet Coke, cola and chocolate as improvised, legal stimulant patches.
From the framework in this paper, that isn't random:

It is exactly what you would expect if susceptible, dopamine-hungry nervous systems are unconsciously gravitating toward Coke/Diet Coke as accessible micro-stimulants, with trace coca-derived components acting as one more tiny push on an already high-gain system.

The Bottom Line on Clinical Patterns
These patterns are not universal, and many people drink Coke or Diet Coke without any obvious problem. But in susceptible individuals—those with highly reactive nervous systems, anxiety/ADHD/trauma histories, or prior stimulant exposure—the combination of:

Specific brand craving
Reproducible state changes
Resistance to stopping despite insight

...looks less like a casual beverage habit and more like a mild, legal micro-stimulant relationship hiding in plain sight.
It is this subset, not the general population, that this paper is concerned with.

Branding the Feeling: When the Market Message Matches the Mechanism
Coca-Cola has never really sold "a cola." For decades, its advertising has focused not on ingredients, but on state:

"It's the real thing"
"You can't beat the feeling"
"Taste the feeling"
"Things go better with Coke"

These are not descriptions of a flavour profile. They are direct appeals to how Coke makes you feel—positioning the drink as a reliable state-change tool.
For most consumers, this is just clever branding. For susceptible individuals, it can feel uncomfortably literal.
If Coke and Diet Coke act as mild, legal micro-stimulants in a subset of people with highly reactive nervous systems, then the slogans are doing double duty:

On the surface, they sell a lifestyle and an emotion
At a deeper level, they resonate with the lived reality of people who really do experience Coke as something you "can't beat the feeling" of, and who reach for it to make "things go better"

From the inside of a susceptible nervous system, the brand message can feel less like advertising and more like recognition:

"Here is the thing that fixes your state. Here is the thing you rely on."

Important Precision
It is important to be precise:

We do not have evidence that Coca-Cola is intentionally formulating for micro-stimulant effects in susceptible individuals or knowingly exploiting trace alkaloids in that way

What we do have is an uncanny alignment between:

A product that, for some people, functions as a subtle psychoactive (potentially including contributions from trace coca alkaloids in decocainized flavour extracts), and
A decades-long marketing strategy built around feelings, performance, and life going "better with Coke"

For a subset of susceptible brains, that combination can turn a branded beverage into a socially invisible dependence loop:

The culture calls it "just soda"
The ads call it a feeling
The nervous system quietly treats it as a drug

From their perspective, the advertising doesn't just sell Coke—it almost feels like it's winking at them about what it actually does.

What Would Actually Settle This?
If Coca-Cola and regulators want to definitively clear decocainized coca components, the path is straightforward:
1. Independent Chemical Analysis
What: Analyze decocainized coca flavour extracts
Looking for: Not just cocaine, but all detectable alkaloids and bioactive candidates
At: Realistic beverage concentrations
2. Blinded Human Studies
Who: Susceptible vs control individuals
What they receive (under blind conditions):

Standard Coke/Diet Coke
Formulations identical except for the absence of coca-derived flavouring
Caffeine/sugar-matched non-coke colas

What we measure (with high sensitivity):

Anxiety ratings (0-10 scale)
Restlessness, "wired/tired" feelings
Craving or urge to drink more
Heart rate and heart rate variability
Sleep latency and quality that night
Simple reaction-time or working-memory tasks
Choice tests (which drink they prefer when blinded)
Willingness to delay or skip the next cola serving
Self-reported "need" for the drink

The Key Questions
The key question is not whether Coke behaves like a large dose of cocaine.
The key questions are:

In susceptible individuals, do Coke/Diet Coke consistently produce measurably different state shifts, cravings, or preferences compared to other caffeine/sugar-matched beverages—even when branding and appearance are controlled?

If a coca-flavour-free formulation can be tested:

Does removing coca-derived flavour components reduce:

Craving
State shift magnitude
"Need this specific drink" behaviour
...relative to standard Coke/Diet Coke?



What the Results Would Mean
If:

Coke/Diet Coke do not differ from non-coca colas in susceptible individuals under those conditions, and
Decocainized extracts show no plausible psychoactive candidates at physiologically relevant levels

Then: The trace-alkaloid hypothesis will have been falsified or downgraded. The story would likely shift toward "caffeine + sweetener + conditioning + absorption kinetics" doing most of the work.
Until such data exist, however, the current situation is:

A globally consumed product with a unique coca-derived flavour source
Minimal study at milliamp sensitivity in the right population
A clinically recognizable subset whose brains treat it like a drug

From a safety and scientific standpoint, that is enough to warrant serious, focused investigation.

Not "Ban Coke," But Map Its Territory
It is important to be clear about what this paper is not saying.
It is not arguing that Coca-Cola should be banned, nor that trace coca alkaloids (if present at ultra-low levels in decocainized extracts) are inherently unacceptable in a beverage.
In fact, it is entirely possible that:

For many people, Coke and Diet Coke remain harmless background beverages
For a subset of susceptible individuals, they are net harmful at their current dose and frequency, primarily through anxiety, sleep disruption, and quiet dependence
For another subset, there may be a real, functional benefit—for example, ADHD-pattern brains that find Coke/Diet Coke more helpful than formal medication, or prefer it because it feels gentler, familiar, and controllable

The Real Problem
The problem is not that a common beverage can have psychoactive effects.
The problem is that:

Those effects are not openly framed as such
The most vulnerable users are never told they are in a risk band
The potential "therapeutic" lane is completely unmapped and unguardrailed

The Nicotine Analogy Again
In that sense, the situation is closer to nicotine in very low doses:

A tiny nicotine micro-dose in water may do nothing for most people
The same trace dose in a heavily nicotine-sensitized, craving smoker can genuinely change their state

From the outside, the dose looks "too small to matter."
From the inside of the right nervous system, it is enough.
What Coke/Diet Coke May Be Doing
Coke and Diet Coke may be occupying a similar space for susceptible brains:

At 1–2 L/day, over years, with ADHD/trauma/anxiety in the background, even trace psychoactive contributions from coca-derived flavour components could matter—especially layered on top of caffeine, sugar/sweetener, and conditioning
For some, that may mean overstimulation and anxiety
For others, it may mean a preferred, familiar micro-stimulant they consciously or unconsciously choose instead of formal medication

What Should Happen If the Hypothesis Is Confirmed
If future studies confirm that:

Coke/Diet Coke act as micro-stimulants in a defined subset of sensitive users, and
Trace coca alkaloids or other cola-specific components contribute to that effect

Then the logical next step is not moral panic, but clear definition of the lane:

Transparent communication that "for some brains, this is not neutral—it's a psychoactive tool"
Practical guidance on safe upper bounds for high-risk groups (e.g., chronic anxiety, insomnia, ADHD on stimulants, trauma histories)
Exploration—carefully and ethically—of whether there is a legitimate, safer therapeutic window where cola-like formulations could be used intentionally rather than accidentally, instead of people discovering it haphazardly in supermarket bottles

The Goal
In other words: the goal is not to declare Coke "bad," but to stop pretending it is the same thing for every nervous system.

For robust, average brains, it may stay what it has always been: a sweet, caffeinated drink
For susceptible brains, it may need to be treated—and labeled—as what it already functions as in real life: a mild, legal micro-stimulant whose dose, frequency, and context matter


Limitations: What We Don't Yet Know
This is a hypothesis-generating paper. Several limitations are important to state explicitly:

There is currently no published, independent alkaloid profiling of decocainized coca extracts at realistic beverage concentrations
Sensitization and sub-threshold dose arguments are drawn largely from animal and indirect human data and extrapolated to everyday products
The clinical patterns described here are based on observation and self-report, not on a formal cohort study with controls
Alternative explanations—caffeine pharmacogenetics, sweeteners, carbonation, and conditioning—may fully explain the observed effects; the trace alkaloid hypothesis is a prioritized mechanism to test, not a concluded fact

These limitations do not make the question trivial; they are precisely why targeted chemistry and well-designed human studies are needed.

STATUS: Hypothesis Requiring Proper Testing, Not Proven Fact
This paper argues that for a subset of susceptible individuals, Coke/Diet Coke may function as mild, legal micro-stimulants—helping explain why some athletes swear by them and why some people cannot quit despite repeated attempts.
The working model treats trace coca-derived alkaloids as the prime suspect—not in the sense of a proven cause, but because, given their uniqueness to Coke/Diet Coke and their historical psychoactive context, they should be the first mechanistic candidate rigorously tested and either cleared or confirmed, rather than being assumed irrelevant by default.
Until that testing is done, we cannot know for certain. But the clinical patterns, the sensitization science, and the unique ingredient profile all point in a direction that warrants serious investigation.
